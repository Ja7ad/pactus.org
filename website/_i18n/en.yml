      Welcome to the Pactus contribution page!
      We're glad you're interested in contributing to our open-source and community-driven project.
      Our goal is to create a secure and decentralized network that empowers individuals to participate
      in the network without the need for intermediaries.
      <br><br>
      There are several ways to support the Pactus project:
    run_a_node: Run a Node
    run_a_node_desc: >
      One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
      A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and helps maintain the network
      by validating transactions and blocks.
      By running a node, you help ensure the network remains secure and decentralized, as it reduces the risk of
      any one entity gaining too much control or influence over the network.
      <br><br>
      To run a Pactus node, you will need to have stake in the network, but there is no limit to the amount of stake you can have.
      Having your own node means you don't have to rely on a third-party to provide information about the state of the network,
      which increases your level of security and control over your interactions with the Pactus network.

    title: FAQ
    welcome: Find answers to recurring questions and concerns about Pactus.
    what_does_pactus_mean: What does "Pactus" mean?
    what_does_pactus_mean_answer_v1: >
      The word "Pactus" is of Latin origin and means "to agree together", "contract", or "transact".
      In English, the term "Pact" is derived from the Latin word "Pactus".
    how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin: How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?
    how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin_answer_v1: >
      Pactus and Bitcoin are two different types of blockchain networks.
      While Bitcoin uses a process called "Proof of Work" to secure its network, Pactus uses a different method called "Proof of Stake".
      This means that instead of mining, validators are responsible for voting on incoming blocks. Once a validator proposes a valid block and it is accepted by other validators, the validator receives one coin as a block reward.
      This helps keep the Pactus blockchain secure and decentralized.
    how_is_pactus_different_from_ethereum: How is Pactus different from Ethereum?
    how_is_pactus_different_from_ethereum_answer_v1: >
      Pactus and Ethereum are both Proof of Stake blockchains, but they differ in their approach to running a validator.
      Running a validator on Ethereum can be challenging and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum coins to stake.
      In contrast, Pactus is designed to be more accessible to normal users.
      There is no minimum stake requirement, and you can run the Pactus node on any operating system with basic hardware.
      This approach reflects our commitment to promoting decentralization and making blockchain technology accessible to a wider audience.
    what_are_validators: What are validators?
    what_are_validators_answer_v1: >
      Validators on Pactus are responsible to processing transactions and creating blocks and, by doing so, helping secure the network.
      They use their own coins as a stake to ensure the network's security and receive rewards for their contributions.
    how_do_validators_get_rewarded: How do validators get rewarded?
    how_do_validators_get_rewarded_answer_v1: >
      Every 10 seconds, one validator is chosen to collect transactions and create a block.
      The first transaction in the proposed block is called the "reward" transaction.
      This transaction includes one coin as a block reward and transaction fees.
      If most of the committee members approve the proposed block, the block is accepted and the validator receives the reward.
      The reward helps incentivize validators to secure the network and keep it running smoothly.
    how_many_validators_does_pactus_have: How many validators does pactus have?
    how_many_validators_does_pactus_have_answer_v1: >
      Pactus is a real Proof of Stake blockchain, which means there is no limit on the number of validators in the network.
      However, there is a fixed committee of 21 validators responsible for creating blocks.
      These committee members are randomly chosen from the pool of validators in the network.
    what_are_the_minimum_and_maximum_amounts_i_can_stake: What are the minimum and maximum amounts I can stake?
    what_are_the_minimum_and_maximum_amounts_i_can_stake_answer_v1: >
      In Pactus, there is no minimum limit for staking coins, but the maximum amount you can stake is 12381 coins.
      If you want to stake more than 12381 coins, you can run a new validator.
      Running multiple validators keeps the network more decentralized and helps maintain its security and stability.
    what_is_the_total_supply_of_pactus_coins: What is the total supply of Pactus coins?
    what_is_the_total_supply_of_pactus_coins_answer_v1: >
      Pactus has a total supply of 21 million coins, and each coin is divided into 1 billion units.
      A new coin is generated every 10 seconds, and after 6 and a half years, all 21 million coins will be generated.
    is_pactus_a_copy_of_any_other_blockchain: Is Pactus a copy of any other blockchain?
    is_pactus_a_copy_of_any_other_blockchain_answer_v1: >
      No, Pactus is not a copy or a derivative of any other blockchain.
      It is a new and unique blockchain protocol that has been designed from scratch.
      The consensus mechanism used in Pactus is unique and specifically created to solve the scalability issue of validators in the Proof of Stake blockchains.
    what_is_the_treasury_account: What is the Treasury account in Pactus blockchain?
    what_is_the_treasury_account_answer_v1: >
      The Treasury account is a special account in Pactus blockchain that holds the total supply of coins, which is 21 million coins.
      It is created at the genesis time and has no key pair associated with it, meaning it cannot be accessed or controlled by anyone.
      Every time a block is created, one coin from the Treasury account moves to the proposer account as a block reward.
      This helps to incentivize validators to secure the network and keep it running smoothly.
    does_pactus_have_an_ico: Does Pactus have an ICO?
    does_pactus_have_an_ico_answer_v1: >
      No, Pactus does not have an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and there are no predefined or privileged accounts in pactus.
      The Pactus blockchain starts from zero and all coins are minted through the consensus mechanism.
      This ensures that the distribution of coins is fair and there is no centralization of wealth.
