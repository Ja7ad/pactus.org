  faq_intro_v1: Find answers to recurring questions and concerns about Pactus.
  faq_what_does_pactus_mean: What does "Pactus" mean?
  faq_what_does_pactus_mean_answer_v1: >
    The word "Pactus" is of Latin origin and means "to agree together", "contract", or "transact".
    In English, the term "Pact" is derived from the Latin word "Pactus".
  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin: How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?
  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin_answer_v1: >
    Pactus and Bitcoin are two different types of blockchain networks.
    While Bitcoin uses a process called "Proof of Work" to secure its network, Pactus uses a different method called "Proof of Stake".
    This means that instead of mining, validators are responsible for voting on incoming blocks. Once a validator proposes a valid block and it is accepted by other validators, the validator receives one coin as a block reward.
    This helps keep the Pactus blockchain secure and decentralized.
  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_ethereum: How is Pactus different from Ethereum?
  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_ethereum_answer_v1: >
    Pactus and Ethereum are both Proof of Stake blockchains, but they differ in their approach to running a validator.
    Running a validator on Ethereum can be challenging and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum coins to stake.
    In contrast, Pactus is designed to be more accessible to normal users.
    There is no minimum stake requirement, and you can run the Pactus node on any operating system with basic hardware.
    This approach reflects our commitment to promoting decentralization and making blockchain technology accessible to a wider audience.
  faq_what_are_validators: What are validators?
  faq_what_are_validators_answer_v1: >
    Validators on Pactus are responsible to processing transactions and creating blocks and, by doing so, helping secure the network.
    They use their own coins as a stake to ensure the network's security and receive rewards for their contributions.
  faq_how_do_validators_get_rewarded: How do validators get rewarded?
  faq_how_do_validators_get_rewarded_answer_v1: >
    Every 10 seconds, one validator is chosen to collect transactions and create a block.
    The first transaction in the proposed block is called the "reward" transaction.
    This transaction includes one coin as a block reward and transaction fees.
    If most of the committee members approve the proposed block, the block is accepted and the validator receives the reward.
    The reward helps incentivize validators to secure the network and keep it running smoothly.
  faq_how_many_validators_does_pactus_have: How many validators does pactus have?
  faq_how_many_validators_does_pactus_have_answer_v1: >
    Pactus is a real Proof of Stake blockchain, which means there is no limit on the number of validators in the network.
    However, there is a fixed committee of 21 validators responsible for creating blocks.
    These committee members are randomly chosen from the pool of validators in the network.
  faq_what_are_the_minimum_and_maximum_amounts_i_can_stake: What are the minimum and maximum amounts I can stake?
  faq_what_are_the_minimum_and_maximum_amounts_i_can_stake_answer_v1: >
    In Pactus, there is no minimum limit for staking coins, but the maximum amount you can stake is 12381 coins.
    If you want to stake more than 12381 coins, you can run a new validator.
    Running multiple validators keeps the network more decentralized and helps maintain its security and stability.
  faq_what_is_the_total_supply_of_pactus_coins: What is the total supply of Pactus coins?
  faq_what_is_the_total_supply_of_pactus_coins_answer_v1: >
    Pactus has a total supply of 21 million coins, and each coin is divided into 1 billion units.
    A new coin is generated every 10 seconds, and after 6 and a half years, all 21 million coins will be generated.
