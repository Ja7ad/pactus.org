# Block Certificate

## What Is Certificate?

Block certificate holds the proof of commitment for the block. A valid block should come with a
valid certificate before committing into the blockchain.

## Certificate Verification

For each round validators cast their votes by signing `BlockHash | Round`. A valid certificate
should have signatures from validators with more than â…” of the stake for that round. If enough votes
are collected, the signatures will be aggregated into one single signature. To verify the aggregated
signature, from `Committers` and `Absentees` the aggregated public key can be formed and therefore
Signature can be verified.

## Certificate Structure

Each block certificate contains following information:

{% tabs certificate %}

{% tab certificate rust <i class="fa-brands fa-rust"></i> Rust %}

```rust
pub struct Certificate {
    round: i16,
    committers: Vec<i32>,
    absentees: Vec<i32>,
    signature: Signature,
}
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab certificate go <i class="fa-brands fa-golang"></i> Go %}

```go
type Certificate struct {
    Round      int16
    Committers []int32
    Absentees  []int32
    Signature  Signature
}
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

### Example

Hers is an example of a certificate data.

{% hexdump "certificate_data"
  "0604040b1726010ba33cf343625e9a4a8fa966045417084608e4cc2eb01b1348"+
