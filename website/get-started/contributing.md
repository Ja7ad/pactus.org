Welcome to the Pactus contribution page!
We're glad you're interested in contributing to our open-source and community-driven project.
Our goal is to create a secure and decentralized network that empowers individuals to participate
in the network without the need for intermediaries.

There are several ways to support the Pactus project:

## Run a Node

One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and helps maintain the network
by validating transactions and blocks.
By running a node, you help ensure the network remains secure and decentralized, as it reduces the risk of
any one entity gaining too much control or influence over the network.

To run a Pactus node, you will need to have stake in the network, but there is no limit to the amount of stake you can have.
Having your own node means you don't have to rely on a third-party to provide information about the state of the network,
which increases your level of security and control over your interactions with the Pactus network.

## Develop

Pactus is an open-source project, and we welcome and encourage contributions from developers.
By contributing to the project, you can help improve the Pactus platform and create new features that
benefit the entire community.
We have a variety of areas where we need development work, such as improving the performance of the Pactus blockchain,
adding new features to the Pactus, or building new tools for developers to use.
You can check our [Contributing](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) page
for more information on how to get involved and contribute to the project.

## Spread the Word

Another way to support the Pactus project is by spreading the word to others in your community.
The more people who know about Pactus, the more opportunities there are for collaboration and growth.
Share our project on social media, attend Pactus events, or simply tell your friends and colleagues about us.

Every little bit helps!
