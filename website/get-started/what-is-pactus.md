# {% t dict.what_is_pactus.title %}

**Pactus** is an open-source and community-driven blockchain.
There is no specified owner or company structure behind it, and there is no CEO who decides its future.
Instead, the community, including developers, validators, and liquidity holders, holds authority in the project.
They determine its development course, control resources, and make decisions.

**Pactus** is designed from the ground up to be a "pure" blockchain protocol.
It does not hold any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens.
It has a fixed supply of tokens generated at genesis.
These tokens are distributed over time as block rewards to well-behaving validators who support the network
by providing storage and processing power.

**Pactus** is secured through a real Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism,whereby stakes are locked on the network
to prevent any malicious or “Byzantine” behaviors that could potentially disrupt network operations.

**Pactus** starts with four bootstrap validators without any stake, and anyone can join the network by staking some tokens.
A group of 21 validators secures the network and validates blocks. However, unlike a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain,
this group is not fixed. Pactus solves validators' scalability problem with a clever and secure mechanism.
The set of validators in Pactus is dynamic and flexible, unlike the fixed and governed set of validators
in other blockchain systems.
